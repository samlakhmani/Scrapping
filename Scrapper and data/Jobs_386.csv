87,Data Analyst,"A NEW SOCIAL FUTURE ��‍��‍


How is it that in a world that's evolving so quickly that social products still feel the same? Strangely enough, we're still using products that were invented in the 2G era. There seems to be an emptiness with the current experience and today's products are built to force humanity to be superficial.

We'd like to change that.

With the advancements in technology, so much more is possible today that wasn't even possible, just a few years ago. We believe the timing couldn't be better.

6 PRINCIPLES ��


We’re thoughtful about why we do things and here are 6 principles guiding our thinking:
Advancements in Tech & AI: Allowing more bits to be pushed to users in real-time and thus allowing far richer, more personalised experiences.
Bits Cheaper than Atoms: Today, bringing rich, luxurious experiences to the masses is faster, more efficient and cheaper online than it is offline.
Self Worth Moving Online: 40% of people's waking life is now spent on their smartphones. The next generation is far more comfortable online than offline.
Vertical Communities: We don't live our lives in one massive community. We're specific in the activities we engage in (art, gaming, fitness etc).
New Business Models: Putting customer at the centre. These won't be ad-driven in the traditional sense. Think micro-transactions, subscriptions and more.
Consumers as Owners: It's a bit strange that consumers aren't part of the value chain. Turning customers into owners is a fascinating thought.

BUILD MAGICAL THINGS ��


It’s so clear to us that technology evolves but people stay the same. We’re solving for a core human need - social connection and with all the evolution in technology, today we can solve for that in brand new ways.

At our core, we’re a creative company. Ideas and pixels is where we live and we love building magical products that make our users feel ‘wow’ inside. It’s not just about features, it’s also about how they make people feel. We build at the intersection of the scientific and the romantic.

And it all starts with people, the right team that cares deeply about our mission, values and our users. At hike, you'll have the chance to do the best work of your life.

Come join us and shape the future of social.

THE HIKE CODE


We’re on a journey to build something new, something different and making anything innovative & new requires the ability to surrender to the unknown. The Hike Code is our value system. It is our guide to navigate through the unknown to build incredible products. Here they are:
Top Talent in Every Role: We look for people with an incredible intellect. Both skills and values are important to us.
Pro-Sports Team: Strengths based, results driven with a ""team-first"" attitude
Customer at the Centre: Everything we do is inspired by how can we better solve for our customer.
Constant Innovation: It's our DNA to walk into the unknown in search of having meaningful impact.
Act Like Owners: We own the output of what we do, even if it's explicitly not our job.
Thoughtful Decision Making: Clear Mind + Obsession to Simplify + Data Driven. We strive to be thoughtful.
Always be Hustling: We understand that success is not one big leap but tiny gains compounding over time #ABH.
Be Open Minded & Coachable: We have a quest to continuously #RiseUp to be the best version of ourselves.

ROLE & REQUIREMENTS ��


If you’ve made it till here, then you’re probably interested in the role :)

Key Day to Day Responsibilities:
Perform quantitative analyses that translate data into actionable insights and provide analytical, data-driven decision-making support for key projects.
Provide reporting and performance monitoring to product teams using data drawn from diverse sources.
Own and evangelize data-driven experimentation in the team to improve the product offerings, and document it.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Broad range of business and IT experiences; Has achieved technical and/or business certification(s).
Skills/Competencies:

Communication: Data scientists must communicate effectively up and down the data supply chain: first, to obtain access to the data they require; second, to work with those who understand the business meaning behind the data; and third, to articulate findings and implications to business leaders in language they understand. A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.

Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.

Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.

Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.

Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.

Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.

Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.

Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.

Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.

Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.

Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.

Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.

Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

Who we are:
We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.

Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You’ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he’s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You’ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and through we are a start-up, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our Pune office space is modest. We prefer to pay you more than prevailing market wages rather than spend money on fancy office space.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.

Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs

You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras

Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib and commonly used libraries
You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost etc thoroughly

You are quick to understand business problems and understand how to classify problems that exist in large datasets

Any data visualization experience is a plus as is any background in statistics

You have developed, implemented and supported a ML application successfully at work
