18,Data Analyst,"A NEW SOCIAL FUTURE ��‍��‍


How is it that in a world that's evolving so quickly that social products still feel the same? Strangely enough, we're still using products that were invented in the 2G era. There seems to be an emptiness with the current experience and today's products are built to force humanity to be superficial.

We'd like to change that.

With the advancements in technology, so much more is possible today that wasn't even possible, just a few years ago. We believe the timing couldn't be better.

6 PRINCIPLES ��


We’re thoughtful about why we do things and here are 6 principles guiding our thinking:
Advancements in Tech & AI: Allowing more bits to be pushed to users in real-time and thus allowing far richer, more personalised experiences.
Bits Cheaper than Atoms: Today, bringing rich, luxurious experiences to the masses is faster, more efficient and cheaper online than it is offline.
Self Worth Moving Online: 40% of people's waking life is now spent on their smartphones. The next generation is far more comfortable online than offline.
Vertical Communities: We don't live our lives in one massive community. We're specific in the activities we engage in (art, gaming, fitness etc).
New Business Models: Putting customer at the centre. These won't be ad-driven in the traditional sense. Think micro-transactions, subscriptions and more.
Consumers as Owners: It's a bit strange that consumers aren't part of the value chain. Turning customers into owners is a fascinating thought.

BUILD MAGICAL THINGS ��


It’s so clear to us that technology evolves but people stay the same. We’re solving for a core human need - social connection and with all the evolution in technology, today we can solve for that in brand new ways.

At our core, we’re a creative company. Ideas and pixels is where we live and we love building magical products that make our users feel ‘wow’ inside. It’s not just about features, it’s also about how they make people feel. We build at the intersection of the scientific and the romantic.

And it all starts with people, the right team that cares deeply about our mission, values and our users. At hike, you'll have the chance to do the best work of your life.

Come join us and shape the future of social.

THE HIKE CODE


We’re on a journey to build something new, something different and making anything innovative & new requires the ability to surrender to the unknown. The Hike Code is our value system. It is our guide to navigate through the unknown to build incredible products. Here they are:
Top Talent in Every Role: We look for people with an incredible intellect. Both skills and values are important to us.
Pro-Sports Team: Strengths based, results driven with a ""team-first"" attitude
Customer at the Centre: Everything we do is inspired by how can we better solve for our customer.
Constant Innovation: It's our DNA to walk into the unknown in search of having meaningful impact.
Act Like Owners: We own the output of what we do, even if it's explicitly not our job.
Thoughtful Decision Making: Clear Mind + Obsession to Simplify + Data Driven. We strive to be thoughtful.
Always be Hustling: We understand that success is not one big leap but tiny gains compounding over time #ABH.
Be Open Minded & Coachable: We have a quest to continuously #RiseUp to be the best version of ourselves.

ROLE & REQUIREMENTS ��


If you’ve made it till here, then you’re probably interested in the role :)

Key Day to Day Responsibilities:
Perform quantitative analyses that translate data into actionable insights and provide analytical, data-driven decision-making support for key projects.
Provide reporting and performance monitoring to product teams using data drawn from diverse sources.
Own and evangelize data-driven experimentation in the team to improve the product offerings, and document it.
Enable product reviews, deep dives and analyses through the effective use of data and communicate and report insights and recommendations to shape product strategy.
Ensure that any data required for carrying out the other responsibilities for the product/features you’re working on is properly instrumented and logged.

About Standard Chartered
We are a leading international bank focused on helping people and companies prosper across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

To us, good performance is about much more than turning a profit. It's about showing how you embody our valued behaviours - do the right thing, better together and never settle - as well as our brand promise, Here for good.

The Role Responsibilities

A Data Analyst interprets data and helps turn it into information that enables or improves a business process, thus affecting business decisions. Data Analysts gather information from various sources and interpret patterns and trends to make it digestible for others. They must have strong analytical skills, but above all have a burning curiosity to understand, and make sense of, data. They will work closely with:

Data Managers, who define the team's business requirements, objectives, strategy and priorities
Data Engineers, who design and implement the processes by which data is collected and generated
Data Quality Analysts, who define data quality control requirements and oversee these on a day to day basis to ensure constant system health
Upstream data teams, who provide the data that the analyst is sourcing
Downstream Process Owners, who depend on the data to perform their business function

Data Analysts spend much of their time working with stakeholders to define data requirements, data transformation logic and supporting the delivery of these requirements from start to finish. They are experts in profiling data to understand its contents and will also have a working understanding of the business process or product that generated it in the first place. Data Analysts are the entry point to the FCC Data Team for most external stakeholders and as such will have a broad, but still detailed, understanding of all the data available and constantly seek opportunities for innovation and expansion. They are the primary liaison between up- and downstream teams.

Define clear, concise and detailed business requirements for FCC Data that clearly document the data elements and formats that are needed, outline detailed transformation expectations and list the critical data elements that will enable downstream processes to operate effectively
Create and maintain documentation that articulates the process by which data is extracted, transformed and loaded in FCC that can be shared and understood by others
Work with downstream FCC business process owners to constantly improve, refine and expand the datasets to improve the quality and effectiveness of those processes, as well as help them to make sense of the data, providing training where required, and derive meaningful BI / MI
Conduct detailed analysis of upstream changes that impact FCC data – for example the introduction of a new products – to ensure that requirements remain up to date and define any new ones as necessary
Identify areas of overlap or data gaps that can lead to increased value, either by eliminating redundant processes or expanding existing data models
Produce accurate and insightful dashboards and reports detailing the health, content and insights available from the data, making that actionable for stakeholders and meaningful for management decision making.
Regulatory & Business Conduct

Display exemplary conduct and live by the Group’s Values and Code of Conduct.

Take personal responsibility for embedding the highest standards of ethics, including regulatory and business conduct, across Standard Chartered Bank. This includes understanding and ensuring compliance with, in letter and spirit, all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines and the Group Code of Conduct.

Effectively and collaboratively identify, escalate, mitigate and resolve risk, conduct and compliance matters.

Our Ideal Candidate
Minimum 5+ years of professional experience as business change analyst in financial markets related banking products
Degree (or similar) in Engineering and MBA is preferred
Able to seamlessly move and translate between detailed functional data requirements and non-technical general terms
The ability to write clear, concise and detailed business requirements that can be understood by data engineers and developers as well as business stakeholders
Competence with data profiling tools and methodologies (SQL at a minimum), with a preference for dedicated and sophisticated tools such as Paxata or Tableau
Familiar with data documentation, delivery workflow and defect tracking tools – JIRA and Confluence in particular
Demonstrated experience in handling and understanding large datasets and relational databases
Experience in analytical roles with a large technical component, although not necessarily from a purely data perspective (e.g. they may have prior working knowledge of upstream or downstream processes that is relevant from a data perspective)
Evidenced ability to execute and enhance a process to maintain data transformation requirements over time and constantly seek to improve these
High quality written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to focus on multiple initiatives and data subjects (types of data or varying sources of data) at the same time

This is Samvid, co-founder and product lead. I wanted this to be a bit informal, so I'm just gonna talk here instead of creating a document.

Job Location: Gurgaon, Currently Remote due to Coronavirus Indefinitely

Compensation: 0 - 10,000/month

Our Vision

We're looking to recruit for the core team of our funded startup.

Less than 1% of people complete their New Year's resolution. Less than 9% do something about it after the first week.

We believe that the main challenge of our times is self-regulation and self discipline. For this, technology should be a solution and not the primary cause for distractions. We want to tackle this by using behavioural psychology, AI & games to help achieve our goals through small, byte sized habits.

Learn more about our product & vision here : http://bit.ly/AtmVsn

Who We Are

We have experience in building products as a core part of other startups (nearbuy, Limetray) and have used these opportunities to understand how to build technology businesses from the grounds-up. Gaurav and I are founders, and batchmates from NSIT CS, batch of 2013.

Who We Are Looking For

We are a team of about 5 right now and are looking to expand to 15. We need people across product, engineering and design. The way we see everyone's role at Atom is that everyone has a core competency which will be their primary responsibility, beyond which, each person has the right to choose to do more than just their role. We distribute tasks democratically and we will continue to do that as part of our culture.

Why should you join ?

The main takeaway for people wouldn't be the pay, if money is in your top three motivations to apply, I would discourage you from applying. We are at a point where we want to figure out product-market fit and as part of a small organisation you learn how to do that. Additionally, you will learn how to build and launch a consumer product for the western market, how to setup a team for a startup and more ownership in your field of work. Unless these aren't your priority, or if our vision doesn't appeal to you I would recommend against this profile.

Interview Process

We do this quite differently, for reasons that seem obvious to us. Basis your CV, we will have a video-call. Post that, we usually like people to come on board with us for 2-3 weeks and work with us. If you're already working, you can do this on weekends. We've seen this work well for us in previous startups mostly because it really helps us understand each other in terms of vision, culture and how we approach problems. This will definitely be more than an employer-employee relationship and we know that first 5-10 people in a startup are absolutely critical, perhaps even more so than founders. This ""trial"" helps both parties sort of de-risk the process.

If you've made it this far, congratulations. You've more focus than the majority. Let's finally get into the actual day-to-day

Responsibilities

Own and manage what to measure and what data to look out, in order to make the organisation more data-informed
Work to prepare experiments and targets for every product launch
Identifying what to measure, and the best way to do so through tools like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel etc.
Understanding and working with data visualisation tools like tableau to enable teams to take better decision
Desired Skills and Experience

We've been thinking about who we want to work with, and how we want the company culture to be quite deeply. Though this is something that we know will change, we want to make it as explicit. View our values here : http://bit.ly/AtmCltr

Viral hepatitis in India is increasingly recognized as a serious public health problem resulting in significant health, social and economic burdens on the affected individuals, their families, as well as the country’s health system. Despite significant progress in the availability of treatment, access to diagnosis remains a major challenge in the path to elimination. Global data suggests a higher prevalence and transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HCV among prisoners. Studies have found that HCV infection prevalence in prisons is higher than in normal population, ranging from 3.1% to 38% depending on HCV endemicity in the geographical location of the prison.
FIND will conduct Hepatitis C micro-elimination through screening followed by confirmatory HCV diagnosis among prison inmates in Punjab and take further appropriate action under the Government of Punjab and prisons department. The intervention will cover 9 Central and 10 district prisons of Punjab with an estimated 21,400 in-mates during the project period.
